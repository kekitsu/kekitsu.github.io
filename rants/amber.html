    lets begin, shall we? forgive me if this sounds a little weird at all, but i decided to embrace the full chaos within me for once :><br>
    <br>
    in case it isn't obvious who this is about due to where it was posted, this is for you, Amber~! <3<br>
    <br>
    to put it quite bluntly, i'm sick of your shit.<br>
    to get a little bit deeper into what i mean, let's go ahead and start from the top~!<br>
    <br>
    so, this is probably just something minor but fuck it i don't care, it's stuck on my mind so i'll mention it. you're really fuckin standoffish when it comes to pretty much any opinion you have.<br>
    by "standoffish", i mean this to the point that you left my discord server for a few days because we said "we can't overthrow the government right now"<br>
    and then somewhat recently, you started going off on my partner just 'cause they wanted to like, live in a cabin and shit? and you kept going even when me and Rosa were telling you to stop, and i don't give a shit how much you think something like that affects you.<br>
    you need to stop that. it does nothing but hurt people. you know this, in fact, but you keep continuing to be standoffish and incredibly aggressive towards people.<br>
    <br>
    this will lead into the next section~!
    <br>
    <br>
    so now, i'm gonna talk about how you handle your personal god damn drama with people!<br>
    i don't know the exact context or blah blah blah whatever bullshit you wanna spout about what happened with penny, there's no god damn reason to do <a href="https://twitter.com/Catgirl_Natsuki/status/1340899023008518145">this kind of bullshit.</a><br>
    <br>
    if anything, Amber, this just makes you look like you're trying to get people to go after Penny for personal god damn problems that you can either resolve in private or shut the fuck up about.<br>
    and hell, just to add onto this, from what i've gathered nothing truly date-y even happened between Moo and Penny. they were just flirty, Penny didn't even know you two were dating at that point.<br>
    when she learned that you and Moo were together, emotions got the best of her and she blocked you because she got jealous.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    now sure, whatever, nothing really came of it after that point. but, now that i have a segway directly into my next section after this, i will get into why you are handling this horribly and need to keep your damn mouth shut! :><br>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Catgirl_Natsuki/status/1340837581165105155?s=20">this right here!</a> you unblocked Penny specifically so she could see you being a passive-aggressive asshole to you! and what's the fucking point of this, exactly?<br>
    there's literally nothing this does to help anyone or anything, the only purpose this serves is to make things more tense and to give yourself some god damn sense of self-righteousness.<br>
    so, here's where my lil segway begins~!<br>
    it is not okay for you to say who your partner can and can't be with. under <strong>any</strong> circumstance, outside of something like me asking my partner to not be around the person who abused me for two years straight.<br>
    <br>
    here's something else i'd like to mention! everything with Penny and Marina was happening while you and moo were broke up, or when Penny didn't know that you and Marina were dating again. you're pissed off because of something that happened while you let yourself get god damn manipulated into calling marina a fucking predator.<br>
    this entire thing feels quite controlling, doesn't it? you're saying that your partner can't be friends with someone because of something that didn't involve you to begin with, that only started because of your own flaws.<br>
    i'm sorry to tell you, but i think you're making your insecurities become reality regardless of what that reality truly is.<br>
    <br>
    i don't want to ramble on too long now, so i'll leave you with my personal thoughts, m'kay? raw, unfiltered, straight from the heart of this bitch named Ivy who can't help but stick her nose into everything~!<br>
    if i want to do a little thing i do where i apply my past experiences (which trust me, there's quite a few of~!) to the present, you're on a fast track to becomin an abusive partner~!<br>
    everything from the "don't compliment my girlfriend" to the trying to split up your partner and her friends, it's all exaclty what started at the beginning of my relationship with this lil bitch named Shouko!<br>
    and you know what <strong>that turned into?</strong><br>
    i know you do! but, for the sake of anyone else who may be reading this, i'll go ahead and give you a little recap~!<br>
    <br>
    <strong>she abused me for two years straight, and by the end of it i was a broken husk with barely any personality or will to live or dreams or anything. i was absolutely fucking destroyed and if it weren't for the fact that i had people to bail me out of it,<br>
    i wouldn't be here right now.</strong><br>
    now, forgive me if i'm wrong, but you don't want that right? i know that deep down inside you want your partner to be happy and do what she wants!<br>
    so do us a favor, pretty please~?<br>
    <br>
    stop being such a standoffish asshole. stop trying to pick and choose other people's friends. stop posting your personal drama publicly with the intent of sending your followers after another.<br>
    <br>
    ありがとうございます~! - Ivy
